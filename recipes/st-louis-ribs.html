    <h1>St. Louis Ribs</h1>
    <img src="../images/st-louis-ribs.jpeg" alt="St Louis Ribs">
    <p>St Louis Ribs are an absolute staple of any quality barbecue. Cut from the spare rib, these are packed full of flavor. They are larger, flatter, and have a higher fat content than baby back ribs making them so juicy they'll melt in your mouth. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack St Louis Ribs (pre-cut)</li>
        <li>Binding agent - we typically recommend mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup apple juice</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Your favorite rub, we recommend  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meat-Church-Holy-Voodoo-Seasoning/dp/B081LJ6R7V?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&gQT=1" target="_blank">This</a></li>
        <li>A delicious bbq sauce (this part is optional, you can cook them dry if you'd like)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow your ribs to set out at room temperature for about 1 hour, this allows for more even cooking </li>
        <li>Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees</li>
        <li>As your smoker heats up, go ahead and apply your binding agent - we prefer yellow mustard, but you can also use olive oil, honey, or worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>Once you've got your ribs covered in the binding agent, it's time to liberally season them with your favorite rub - don't forget the sides!</li>
        <li>Add wood chips/pellets to your smoker - we prefer hickory, apple, or cherry</li>
        <li>Allow your ribs to smoke at 225 for 3 hours - be patient and don't open your smoker during this period - spritzing is not necessary</li>
        <li>After your ribs have been on smoke for 3 hours, it's time to pull them and wrap them tightly in aluminum foil - at this point, you're going to want to add your pads of butter spread out on the foil as well as the apple juice. This will help keep the ribs moist and help them to braise down those connective tissues</li>
        <li>Add the ribs back to heat for 2 hours - there's no need to add smoke at this point, if you'd like you can bake them in the oven at 225 for this period.</li>
        <li>Now you can pull your ribs, and <i>carefully</i> unwrap them - there will be lots of high temperature steam; so use tongs and watch out! </li>
        <li>For the final hour, lather your ribs up with bbq sauce and allow them to smoke for the final perid.</li>
        <li>Pull your ribs out of the smoker and enjoy! No need to let them rest before serving</li>
    </ol>
